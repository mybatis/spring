  <subsection name="What is MyBatis-Spring?">
      <p>
      MyBatis-Spring integrates MyBatis seamlessly with Spring.
      This library allows MyBatis to participate in Spring transactions, takes care of
      building MyBatis mappers and <code>SqlSession</code>s and inject them into other beans, 
      translates MyBatis exceptions into Spring <code>DataAccessException</code>s, 
      and finally, it lets you build your application code free of 
      dependencies on MyBatis, Spring or MyBatis-Spring.
      </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Motivation">
      <p>
      Spring version 2 only supports iBATIS version 2. An attempt was made to
      add MyBatis 3 support into Spring 3 (see the Spring Jira 
      <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5991">issue</a>).
      Unfortunately, Spring 3 development ended before MyBatis 3 was
      officially released. Because the Spring team did not want to release with
      code based on a non-released version of MyBatis, official Spring support
      would have to wait. Given the interest in Spring support for MyBatis, 
      the MyBatis community decided it was time to reunite the interested contributors 
      and add Spring integration as a community sub-project of MyBatis instead.
      </p>

  <subsection name="Requirements">
    <p>
      Before starting with MyBatis-Spring integration, it is very important
      that you are familiar with both MyBatis and Spring terminology. This
      document does not attempt to provide background information or basic
      setup and configuration tutorials for either MyBatis or Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      MyBatis-Spring requires following versions:

      and Putthiphong Boonphong for the coding, testing and documentation;
      Andrius Juozapaitis, Giovanni Cuccu, Mike Lanyon, Raj Nagappan and Tomas Pinos 
      for their contributions; and Simone Tripodi for finding everyone and
      bringing them all back to the project under MyBatis ;) Without them,
      this project wouldn't exist.
